# FizzBuzz Program README

## Introduction

Welcome to the FizzBuzz program! FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem often used in coding interviews to test basic programming skills. The program is designed to count from 1 to a specified number and print the numbers, with the following exceptions:

- For multiples of 3, "Fizz" is printed instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, "Buzz" is printed instead of the number.
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is printed instead of the number.

This simple program is a great way to practice your coding skills and understanding of conditional statements in programming.
